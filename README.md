# üìä Insurance Pricing Analytics ‚Äî Simulated Data Project

This project showcases the potential of **data-driven pricing strategies** in the insurance sector using a **simulated national dataset**. The goal is to demonstrate how machine learning can be applied to detect pricing inefficiencies, simulate business impact, and guide strategic decisions.

The financial figures and predictions are purely illustrative and represent a simulated nationwide insurance system, not the reality of any specific company.

## üß† Project Overview

### Objectives

- Predict total claim costs per client using a deep neural network (DNN).
- Recommend risk-adjusted premiums with a fixed business margin.
- Detect **underpriced**, **fairly priced**, and **overpriced** policies.
- Prioritize strategic adjustments by region and coverage type.
- Simulate potential **revenue uplift** under different premium adjustment strategies.

### Dataset

The dataset is fully simulated and includes:
- Demographic and policyholder features
- Coverage types and geographic region
- Actual premiums and claim histories

## üìå Key Stages

### ‚úÖ Stage 1: Predictive Modeling
- Trained a fully connected DNN to estimate `TotalPaidClaims` per client.
- Achieved a test MAE of approximately **230,000 Gs**, which corresponds to ~21% of the average claim cost (‚âà 1.1 million Gs).

### ‚úÖ Stage 2: Suggested Premiums
- Recommended premiums were calculated using:  
  `SuggestedPremium = PredictedClaimCost √ó 1.25`  
  (a 25% business margin).
- Policies were labeled based on the difference between actual and suggested premium.

### ‚úÖ Stage 3: Business Impact Simulation
- Simulated the financial effect of correcting mispriced policies.
- Identified regions and coverage types with the largest hidden revenue gaps.

### ‚úÖ Stage 4: Strategic Pricing Simulation
- Focused on severely underpriced clients only.
- Modeled three policy scenarios to estimate annual uplift:
  - **Status Quo** (no changes)
  - **Full Adoption** (apply all suggested premiums)
  - **Conservative Policy** (adjust only the most underpriced)

---

## üí° Final Insights

- The conservative pricing policy yields a potential uplift of approximately **2.3 billion Gs (~330,000 USD)**.
- Regions such as *Central* and *San Pedro*, as well as *Premium coverage* clients, concentrate most of the underpricing margin.
- A flexible, model-driven pricing strategy enables more **granular and fair premium adjustments**, improving both profitability and market sustainability.

## üöß Future Improvements

- Add quantile-based loss functions to better capture extreme claim values.
- Include confidence intervals or uncertainty estimates for premium recommendations.
- Modularize the codebase into reusable scripts and functions for production.
- Benchmark against traditional actuarial methods (e.g., GLM, credibility theory).
- Integrate real-world elasticity data to validate behavioral assumptions.
